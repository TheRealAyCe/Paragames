==========================
Paragames v1.1

an experimental modification
by the www.Para-Welt.com Team
==========================


Introduction:
----------------
This mod consists of some (currently one) Minigames, which can be
played by starting the mod and selecting it from the menu.
To play it, simply run the installer and open the Paragames shortcut.


Games:
----------------
Para-Memory:
1-4 players can play a memory with unit icons as cards. You can select
if a player is human or AI or not participating. Heroes give you
3 points, normal cards 1. If your "guess" was right, your turn
continues. If you think AI is retarded, you should have seen it
in full-memory mode (when it remembered EVERY card).
